Dear Markas,

This is a special request to ask you to complete the Module Evaluation Survey for the modules that you are studying for this semester.

Your feedback is of great importance to us.  Please access the link below and complete the survey by Saturday, 1st May 2021.

If you have already taken the survey, a big thank you and apologies for emailing you unnecessarily.

Finally, I trust that you are up to date with all your assessment submissions as we get nearer the end of the semester.  Please contact your module leader/tutor if you are experiencing any difficulties with your assessment work.

Keep well and stay safe.

All the best,

John Doe
